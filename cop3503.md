## Important notes
***22 February 2017***  

If you have additional questions while you're reviewing for Midterm Exam #1, send me an email. We can also set up a time to meet if you have more elaborate questions.  

Please work on filling in the skeleton `linked_list.h`. Next week, we will continue with the full solution (which is necessary for PA2). Download the entire `linked_list -> skeleton` directory to your machine (it's in this week's lab folder).

If you would like to view my sample solution to PA1, please ask me in lab or email me to schedule a time to meet. It will not be posted online.  

Git:

* Go through Github's beginning to end tutorial, all in your browser: [Git tutorial](https://try.github.io/)  
* Learn about branching with this excellent graphical tutorial: [Learn Git branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/)  
* Learn about different Git workflows (useful for your team project); I'm personally a big fan of the Feature Branch workflow: [Git workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)  
* A couple Git commands I really like:
{% highlight console %}
$ git log --graph --all --decorate --simplify-by-decoration --oneline
$ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
{% endhighlight %}

PA1:

* It is fine to use static or dynamic arrays as long as you use them correctly. See the lab examples for this week.  
* You're encouraged to create a class and use the filenames "pa1.h" and "pa1.cpp". However, if you choose to do something different, this is fine as well (just make sure to include a README that explains how to compile and run your submission).  
* TAs will only be testing odd numbers between 3 and 15. It is a good idea to practice checking for and handling invalid input, but it is not required.  
* Make sure to compile and test on the CISE machines before submitting. If your file is named "pa1.cpp", use the following to compile and run:
{% highlight console %}
$ # compile
$ g++ -o pa1 pa1.cpp -std=c++11 -Wall
$ 
$ # run
$ ./pa1
{% endhighlight %}  

Next week in lab, we'll be going over the solution to the problem posed in ex3.cpp. If you have time, try to find a solution on your own.
