## Important notes
***3 February 2017***  

PA1:

* It is fine to use static or dynamic arrays as long as you use them correctly. See the lab examples for this week.  
* You're encouraged to create a class and use the filenames "pa1.h" and "pa1.cpp". However, if you choose to do something different, this is fine as well (just make sure to include a README that explains how to compile and run your submission).  
* TAs will only be testing odd numbers between 3 and 15. It is a good idea to practice checking for and handling invalid input, but it is not required.  

Next week in lab, we'll be going over the solution to the problem posed in ex3.cpp. If you have time, try to find a solution on your own.
