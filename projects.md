### [SWAmp](https://github.com/neumannk/swamp)
A simple web-accessible music player. SWAmp integrates with Spotify and allows anyone at an event to add songs to a queue. It features built-in searching and admin controls. (I'm working on this for my senior project, so expect lots of stuff to happen.)
