I’m currently in my third year at the University of Florida studying computer science. My interests include back-end software systems, OOP, and design patterns. I’m also pursuing a minor in electrical engineering.  

My most recent place of employment was at Amazon in the summer of 2015. I interned as a Software Development Engineer on the World Wide Marketing team. I added search functionality, a custom suggestions engine, and an automated data import pipeline to an existing product to handle marketing data at scale. My contributions shipped to over 2000 global users.  

In my spare time, I like to play poker (Hold Em, PLO, Razz, Badugi, 2-7; I’ll play pretty much anything) and learn about new technologies. I’ll also take every opportunity I can get to cook something delicious. (In the past, I spent 10 years playing classical piano. Maybe I’ll get back to that someday.)  

My [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-neumann-392a148a) is a usually-up-to-date superset of what’s on my résumé.  

If you want to keep up with what I’m doing, I occasionally post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neumee500).
