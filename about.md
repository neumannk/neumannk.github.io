I'm currently in my final semester at the University of Florida studying computer science. After graduation, I'm going to relocate to Seattle and work as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon[^1] on the World Wide Advertising Platforms team. My interests include back-end software systems, OOP, and design patterns. 

Some things I like: poker, cooking, binge watching TV shows, beer. Some things I don't like: wearing ties, getting up early. I make lots of Google searches (something like 6,000 annually) and spend lots of time listening to Spotify (over 40,000 minutes last year). I run Linux on all my machines even though I don't always know what I'm doing.  

My [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-neumann-392a148a) is a usually-up-to-date superset of what’s on my résumé.  

If you want to keep up with what I’m doing, I occasionally post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neumee500) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/neumee500). The best way to get in touch with me is [email](mailto:kevin@kneumann.org).
