I'm currently living in Seattle and working as a software dev at Amazon as part of new advertising products. My professional interests include back-end software, SOA, SaaS, Java, and Kotlin.  

Outside of work, I’m still pretty into tech and software, but I also like poker, cooking, beer, and aviation (I’m currently working towards my PPL flying out of KBFI).  

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-neumann-392a148a) is a usually-up-to-date superset of what’s on my résumé.  

If you want to keep up with what I’m doing, I occasionally post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neumee500) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/neumee500). The best way to get in touch with me is [email](mailto:kevin@kneumann.org).
