I'm currently living in Seattle and working as a software development engineer at AWS. 
My professional interests include back-end software, web services, Kotlin, and serverless infrastructure. 
If this site hasn't already made it obvious, I have no interest in front-end or web development.  

I've been a private pilot since 2018, and I'm also an avid sourdough baker.  

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-neumann-392a148a) is a usually-up-to-date superset of what’s on my résumé.
